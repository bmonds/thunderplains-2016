| I am Kent C. Dodds. I work at PayPal as a full stack JavaScript engineer. I host JavaScript Air, the live video broadcast podcast about JavaScript and the web platform. I spend a bit of time on GitHub and Twitter. I’m an Egghead.io and Google Developer Expert. I’m happily married and the father of three kids. I like code. I care about craft, design, tools, and architecture. I like to talk about it. Come chat with me :-)
